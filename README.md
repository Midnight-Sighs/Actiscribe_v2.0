# Actiscribe_v2.0

I decided to redo my capstone for a number of reasons.
* I have more time (i.e. I don't have a two week time limit).
* I've already learned a lot more than I knew then.
    - I started with classes and learned hooks.  Original was an odd blend of both.
    - My router was all over the place and didn't work properly all the time
    - My logic is more concise and less repetative
* I want to use it to learn 
    - Redux Toolkit
    - Unit Testing
    - Breaking down my components even more than I do
    - Custom Hooks
* I want to make it mobile responsive with Flex
